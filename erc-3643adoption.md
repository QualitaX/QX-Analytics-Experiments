# 1. Introduction

Tracking on-chain activities associated with the ERC-3643 standard can be a challenging task. The adoption of ERC standards, especially those related to regulated securities like ERC-3643, might be less widespread and more specialized, making them a bit harder to find. Tracking the adoption requires a deep understanding of the underlying specifications and its requirements, the ability to process, unify and analyze large amounts of data across different EVM chains.

This dashboard aims at providing visibility and transparency into the adoption of ERC-3643. 

ERC-3643 is a standard a standard for EVM-based smart contracts, specifically designed for compliant, regulated and permissioned tokenized assets. It provides a standardized interface for tokenized assets, enabling more efficient and secure transactions.

## 2.1 Our Approach

_Step 1: Understand the IERC3643 interface and its events._

The IERC3643 interface is a critical component of the ERC-3643 standard, providing a structured and standardized approach for creating, managing and transferring security tokens. A primary focus of the IERC3643 interface is to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. If a token implements the IERC3643 interface, then the token is compliant with the ERC3643 standard.

The IERC3643 interface includes the definition of various events such as ComplianceAdded, TokensFrozen, TokensUnfrozen, Paused, Unpaused, RecoverySuccess, and others. These events are used to log significant actions on the blockchain, providing an immutable record that enhances transparency and auditability..

Event signatures are unique to a contract's code and can be a reliable way to identify contracts that implement a certain standard, especially if that standard defines unique events.

List of events:

The reasons for unpausing can vary, such as the resolution of a security concern, completion of maintenance, or fulfillment of compliance criteria. Logging the unpausing action is important for trust and accountability in the contract's operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

_Step 2: Identify ERC3643-compliant tokens based on specific events and their signatures._

In EVM-based smart contracts, events can emit logs which are recorded on the blockchain. These logs often include "topics" used for indexing purposes. The first topic (topic0) usually represents the hash of the event signature, while subsequent topics (like topic1) store indexed event parameters. These indexed topics help in efficiently querying and filtering log data for specific events or conditions, making it easier to track and analyze on-chain activities.

False Positives: Just because a contract emits a certain event, it doesn't guarantee full compliance with ERC-3643. Further verification is necessary.

The ERC-3643 standard requires that all compliant tokens emit an UpdatedTokenInformation event at initial deployment, capturing critical metadata about the token at inception. If any of this information is later modified, the ERC-3643 token contract should emit an additional UpdatedTokenInformation event with the updated details. However, follow-on update events should not be counted as new, unique ERC-3643 tokens, as they represent changes to an existing contract.

In addition, to promote adoption and ensure conformance, the ERC-3643 Association will soon deploy an on-chain factory contract. This factory contract, available open-source at [here](https://github.com/TokenySolutions/T-REX/blob/main/contracts/factory/TREXFactory.sol), will deploy tokens using the Tokeny T-REX standardized suite of contracts and emit a TREXSuiteDeployed event for each new token creation. Stakeholders can easily spin up compliant ERC-3643 tokens by interacting with this factory contract, while our analytics will monitor for the resulting deployment events to track growth.

# 3. Building the ERC-3643 Adoption Tracker

## 3.1 Dataset

The ERC-3643 adoption dashboard utilizes an internally-developed enriched dataset to allow for more performant and cost-effective analytics. Rather than relying solely on expensive third-party datasets, we have supplemented the base data with additional qualitative attributes such as industry categorization. By enhancing the data in-house to align closely with the ERC-3643 Association analytic needs, we have optimized the dashboard to reduce reliance on external data sources, improve query speeds and responsiveness, and contain costs.

The dataset is available publicly: dune.qualitax.dataset_qx_erc3643_trexfactory_data_050224

## 3.2 Data Enrichment Process


## 3.3 Dune Analytics Dashboard PoC

To enable rapid prototyping and iteration, we initially built a proof-of-concept (PoC) version of the ERC-3643 adoption dashboard using Dune Analytics. Leveraging Dune's no-code environment allowed us to deploy an operational dashboard with at zero additional cost. The ease-of-use and flexibility provided by Dune facilitated quick validation of the dashboard concept, dimensions, and initial analytic use cases. Once proven through the PoC, we deployed the custom dashboard on our own infrastructure.
