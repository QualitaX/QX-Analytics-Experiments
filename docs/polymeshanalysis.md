# 1. Introduction



## Why exploring the Polymesh network?



**Growth of Tokenized Asset Market:** The adoption and usage of the Polymesh network can be a strong indicator of the growth and maturation of the market for tokenized assets. As more assets are tokenized using this standard, it reflects an increasing acceptance and utilization of blockchain technology for asset representation, potentially transforming traditional asset markets.

**Innovation and Development Insight:** Monitoring the adoption and usage of the Polymesh network can provide insights into the areas of innovation and development within the blockchain and fintech sectors. It helps in understanding which types of assets are being tokenized and the emerging use cases, guiding future developments and investments in the space.

**Regulatory Landscape Understanding:** The extent to which the Polymesh network is adopted may influence or be influenced by the regulatory landscape. Understanding its adoption can provide insights into how regulations are shaping the market and vice versa. It can also signal the need for new or adapted regulatory frameworks to accommodate the growing market of tokenized assets.

**Investor Interest and Market Dynamics:** Tracking adoption can shed light on investor interest and confidence in tokenized assets. A rising adoption rate might indicate a bullish market sentiment, while stagnation or decline could signal issues or lack of confidence in the market.

## 2.1 Our Approach

_Step 1: Understand Polymesh Data._

To get started install and run Polymesh subquery : https://github.com/PolymeshAssociation/polymesh-subquery . </br>
Use pgAdmin to get a quick overview and understanding of the data.

The query below returns the list of tables and their descriptions.

``` 

SELECT 
    cls.relname AS table_name,
    obj_description(cls.oid) AS table_description
FROM 
    pg_class cls
JOIN 
    pg_namespace ns ON ns.oid = cls.relnamespace
WHERE 
    ns.nspname = 'public' AND 
    cls.relkind = 'r';

```


| table_name     | table_description |
| -------- | ------- |
| debugs | -    |
| found_types  | -    |
| blocks   | A set of transactions that were executed together. Includes a reference to its parent, which reference its parent, this forms a chain to the genesis block   |
| permissions | Represents an Account's permissions. The primary key for an Identity always has full permission |
| _metadata| NULL
| identities | Represents a person or business on chain. All Polymesh assets belong to an Identity. A single Identity can have many accounts (i.e. 'keys') An Identity needs a valid CDD claim from at least one KYC/KYB provider to perform most actions on chain |
| accounts | Represents a public/private key pair. Most actions must be signed by an appropriately permissioned Account. Before an Account can sign most Extrinsics it must first be attached to an Identity |
| account_histories | Represents historical data of identities assigned to an account |
| bridge_events | Represents `POLY`, the Ethereum based ERC-20 token, being converted to POLYX, the native Polymesh token |
| staking_events | Represents a change in staking status |
| assets | Represents a tokenized Asset on the Polymesh chain. The central data structure for the ecosystem |
| ticker_external_agent_actions | Represents an administrative action on an Asset, e.g. tokens issued, compliance rules updated, document added, etc. |
| venues | Represents a place to trade assets. This allows for additional mediation and control over the exchange of Assets e.g. An asset may specify it can only be exchanged at a particular Venue, allowing the Venue owner to explicitly approve transactions |

| agent_group_memberships | Represent membership in a group. Tracks which members belong to which groups |
| portfolio_movements | Represents a transfer of fungible assets between a single identities portfolios. Note: transfers between identities are known as `Settlements` |
| instructions | Represents a request to exchange Assets between parties. Before an Instruction is executed all involved parties must sign and submit an affirmation. Once an Instruction is affirmed it will then be attempted to be executed. If any party fails to satisfy any compliance or transfer restriction the Instruction will fail, and no movement of assets will occur. |
| settlements | Represents a trade of assets between parties |
| legs | Represents the movement of a single Asset in a trade, e.g. Alice will give Bob 1 USDS |

| extrinsics | Represents external data included into the chain. Virtually all user actions, as well as runtime operations are extrinsics. Usually extrinsics are signed. When the block author includes data, e.g. `timestamp.set` then the signature is implied. This is indicated with `signed = 0`| 



_Step 2: Select tables of interest._


| table_name     | table_description |
| -------- | ------- |
| assets  | Represents a tokenized Asset on the Polymesh chain. The central data structure for the ecosystem	 |

| ---------------   | -------------- | -------------- |
| Asset | Volume of asset transactions over time  | Volume of asset transactions per year (excluding issuance) |
| Asset | Volume of asset transactions by asset type by month  | Volume of asset transactions by asset type by month |




### What is the volume of asset transactions over time (excluding issuance)


Useful to assess the liquidity and activity level of assets on the network. A year-over-year analysis can reveal the platform's performance in terms of stakeholder engagement and transaction volume.

Useful to assess the liquidity and activity level of assets on the network. A year-over-year analysis can reveal the platform's performance in terms of user engagement and transaction volume.

```

SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', datetime) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
FROM 
    asset_transactions
GROUP BY 
    month
ORDER BY 
    month;

```

Volume of asset transactions over time 


### What is the volume of asset transactions over time by asset type by month (excluding issuance)

Provide a more granular view of transaction volumes, enabling stakeholders to identify which asset types are most actively traded and when. This can help in spotting trends, seasonal patterns, or emerging asset classes.

``` 

SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', at.datetime) AS month,
    a.type AS asset_type,
    COUNT(at.id) AS transaction_volume
FROM 
    asset_transactions at
JOIN 
    assets a ON at.asset_id = a.id
GROUP BY 
    month, 
    asset_type
ORDER BY 
    month ASC, 
    asset_type;

```

Volume of asset transactions by asset type by month


### What is the Average daily trading volume over the last 120 days ?

This metric helps in understanding the daily liquidity.  It Provides insight into the current liquidity and activity level, offering a more immediate snapshot than annual metrics. It's particularly useful for identifying short-term trends.

``` 

SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', datetime) AS day,
    AVG(amount) AS average_daily_volume
FROM 
    asset_transactions
WHERE 
    datetime >= NOW() - INTERVAL '120 days'
GROUP BY 
    day
ORDER BY 
    day DESC;

```


### What is the Average daily trading volume by asset type over the last 120 days?

This metric helps in understanding the daily liquidity by asset type to provide deeper insights into specific markets.
Similar to the average daily trading volume, but offers a breakdown by asset type.

``` 
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', at.datetime) AS day,
    a.type AS asset_type,
    AVG(at.amount) AS average_daily_volume
FROM 
    asset_transactions at
JOIN 
    assets a ON at.asset_id = a.id
WHERE 
    at.datetime >= NOW() - INTERVAL '120 days'
GROUP BY 
    day, asset_type
ORDER BY 
    day DESC, asset_type;


```


### How many days without trading activities (i.e asset transactions) on the Polymesh network ?

Identifies periods of low activity, which can be helpful for spotting potential issues in market participation or interest in certain assets. It's a good indicator of market health and investor engagement.

``` 

WITH date_series AS (
    SELECT generate_series(
        DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW() - INTERVAL '120 days'),
        DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW()),
        INTERVAL '1 day'
    )::DATE AS day
), 
trading_days AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('day', datetime)::DATE AS trading_day
    FROM 
        asset_transactions
    GROUP BY 
        trading_day
),
days_without_trading AS (
    SELECT 
        ds.day
    FROM 
        date_series ds
    LEFT JOIN 
        trading_days td ON ds.day = td.trading_day
    WHERE 
        td.trading_day IS NULL
)
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', day) AS month,
    COUNT(day) AS days_without_trading
FROM 
    days_without_trading
GROUP BY 
    month
ORDER BY 
    month;

```

### How often assets are being traded, relative to their total supply?

A high turnover ratio indicates a liquid market with active trading, while a low ratio suggests the opposite. This metric is helpful for assessing the efficiency and vibrancy of the market.

Weighted average : TO BE REVIEWED

``` 

SELECT 
    SUM(weighted_turnover) / SUM(a.total_supply) AS weighted_avg_turnover_ratio
FROM (
    SELECT 
        assets.id AS asset_id, 
        assets.total_supply,
        SUM(asset_transactions.amount) AS total_volume,
        (SUM(asset_transactions.amount) / assets.total_supply) * assets.total_supply AS weighted_turnover
    FROM 
        asset_transactions
    JOIN 
        assets ON asset_transactions.asset_id = assets.id
    GROUP BY 
        assets.id, assets.total_supply
) AS a;

```

Individual asset turnover ratio helps understand how actively a specific asset is traded relative to its availability, offering insights into the liquidity and investor interest in that particular asset.
