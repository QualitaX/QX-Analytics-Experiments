# Building the ERC3643 Adoption Tracker

## Our Approach

_Step 1: Understand the IERC3643 interface and its events._

The IERC3643 interface is a critical component of the ERC3643 standard, providing a structured and standardized approach for creating, managing and transferring security tokens. A primary focus of the IERC3643 interface is to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. If a token implements the IERC3643 interface, then the token is compliant with the ERC3643 standard.

The IERC3643 interface includes the definition of various events such as ComplianceAdded, TokensFrozen, TokensUnfrozen, Paused, Unpaused, RecoverySuccess, and others. These events are used to log significant actions on the blockchain, providing an immutable record that enhances transparency and auditability..

Event signatures are unique to a contract's code and can be a reliable way to identify contracts that implement a certain standard, especially if that standard defines unique events.

List of events:

_Step 2: Identify ERC3643-compliant tokens based on specific events and their signatures._

In EVM-based smart contracts, events can emit logs which are recorded on the blockchain. These logs often include "topics" used for indexing purposes. The first topic (topic0) usually represents the hash of the event signature, while subsequent topics (like topic1) store indexed event parameters. These indexed topics help in efficiently querying and filtering log data for specific events or conditions, making it easier to track and analyze on-chain activities.

False Positives: Just because a contract emits a certain event, it doesn't guarantee full compliance with ERC3643. Further verification is necessary.
